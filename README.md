# AirBnB-Seattle-2016-Tableau-Dashboard

Hi everyone,

This is a project which uses the publicly available AirBnB data of certain locations which can be found through the following site:
http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

The data being used for this project is from 2016 and is mainly focused on the Seattle, Washington area.

There are different break downs for revenue, popularity by area, etc... which would be real life use cases that could give insight to a potential client that is looking to buy a property for AirBnB rental purposes in the area.

Hope you enjoy :) 

Thanks!
